# SNHU-CS250
When interpreting user needs the project owner would conduct meetings with the client and sometimes interview the users to keep the backlog updated. Once the backlog has been updated a team can utilize the updated information to update or create user stories. The user stories are small details that are what a user wants, needs, or expects from the project that the team needs to strive to succeed. When approaching a project, I will first consider whether we should use agile. Once we know the style, we can start planning the meetings needed for the project. In future projects, I hope to see more of the Scrum-agile process. Communication seems to be the key to success in almost anything we do, and this process is based on that. Working together not only makes the project successful but also more enjoyable. Being a good team member in software development means communication. It could be good, bad, or ugly but it’s still better than no communication at all. Be there for each team member, life happens, and a team member needs some help or a pick me up. Listen to what each team member has to say and learn from each other’s mistakes.
